# Journal App

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/139102515.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/139102515)

As the name of the project state, Journal App is a journal application where the users can pen down their thoughts and feelings.
it's a project proposed by ALC for the #7DaysofCodeChallenge

The app take advantage of Architecture Components and other components like: Firebase for authentication with Google and Firestore as remote database for persistence, Room library to manage local persistence and offline use.

## Getting Started

You may clone or [download](https://github.com/khammami/journal-app/archive/master.zip) the repo to your local machine and build your own app with Android Studio or just install the demo apk within the repo.

For Google Authentication & Firebase you need to use your own google-services.json. Here how to get yours:

* [Authenticate Using Google Sign-In on Android](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/google-signin)
* [Adding the JSON File](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/google-services-plugin#adding_the_json_file)

You may need to include an api key in your [manifest.xml](https://github.com/khammami/journal-app/blob/411291d3934ded74f1d1c4bfec80a900a321c2a8/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L29) for Fabric if you want or just remove it.

**Firestore rules I've used:**
```
match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId}/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    match /users/{userId}/posts/{postId} {
      allow write: if request.resource.data.updatedAt > resource.data.updatedAt;
      allow write: if !exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)/posts/$(request.resource.data.id))
    }
  }
  ```
